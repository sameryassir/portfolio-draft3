        <p>Bakar is a British singer, songwriter, and model. His full name is Abubakar Baker Shariff-Farr. 
            His genre of music is known to mix many genres together, but can be classified as indie rock. 
            <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/album/1AREUbGCrAwPHXsjjfeQ6d">His professional solo debut was titled "Badkid"</a>,
             and it released in 2018. He models for IMG model agency
             and is under contract with record label Black Butter. Bakar recently announced that will be going on tour this upcoming
            year in the United Kingdom and Ireland. His newest Album, titled "Nobody's Home" will release on February 25th, 2022.
        Bakar has spent a lot of time on social media recently promoting his new album and tour, as he takes a break from modeling
    to focus on his music.</p>

        <p>Bakar has described his music in the past as "schizophrenic". He has also said that he intends to
            "bridge the gap" between genres with his music. Multiple times during interviews, Bakar has been unhappy when people
            have tried to categorize his music. Bakar believes that rather than being confined to one category, his music
            transcends genres. Not only does Bakar's music use many different instruments and sounds, he often changes
            his voice inflection betweeen songs demonstrating large vocal range and flexibility. Bakar has only performed live a handful of times, due
            to much of his uptick in fans happening during the COVID-19 pandemic. His style has been noted as "progressive"
            when compared to other British rock.</p>
